      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Site Blocker guidebook! In the following chapters you will find summarized documentation
          of the Site Blocker Chrome extension and its many capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are looking for help regarding a specific issue, please check the <a href="#faqHeading">FAQ below</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>What it does</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Site Blocker is designed to be the "be all, end all" of site blockers for Chrome.
          Site Blocker allows users to completely block websites as well as specific parts of websites.
          Blocking a website with Site Blocker will block it everywhere (blocking facebook.com will
          block facebook embeds - works the same with reddit, twitter, youtube, etc.) and blocking specific
          patterns/keywords is also possible (users can block every website with the name "Paul" in its URL, etc.).
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>
        How to use
      </h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Left-mouse clicking the Site Blocker extension icon in the Chrome toolbar or menu will summon
          the Site Blocker extension pop-up window. This window is where you will enter websites
          to block, choose block options and see help/examples (visible by left-mouse clicking the "Show help"
          and "Show example" buttons). Although the pop-up window examples are meant to be helpful, they are not
          comprehensive.
          Many of the block options can be used in creative ways not shown in the examples (especially when using the
          wildcard character).
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>
        The wildcard character
      </h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          The wildcard character is a character that will act as a generic placeholder for (almost) any text
          (the wildcard character is set to: * by default). This allows you to block many different websites at once
          and block complex URL patterns. The wildcard character has slightly different behavior depending on block
          option,
          and will be interpretted literally for the <b>Block exact URL</b> option (won't act as a generic placeholder).
        </p>
        <p>
          Blocking <i>reddit.com/*/*</i> with the <b>Block URL and parent URL's</b> or <b>Block URL and child URL's</b>
          options will block:
          <i>reddit.com/u/abc</i>, <i>reddit.com/r/xyz</i>, etc. The wildcard character * in this case will match any
          text that is not empty text or a slash.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blocking <i>reddit.com/*/*</i> with the <b>Block keyword/pattern</b> option will work similarly, but the
          wildcard character * in this case
          will match any text including empty text and slashes. Most of the time, the difference in how the wildcard
          character behaves
          among block options will be unnoticeable.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to change the wildcard character from its * default, you can do so <a
            href="#wildcardHeading">here</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>
        The redirect URL
      </h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          You can set a custom URL to redirect blocked sites to. By default this URL will be empty and you will see a
          "Your file was not found" page when you try to visit a blocked site. You can change your redirect URL <a
            href="#redirectHeading">here</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="exact">Block exact URL</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          This option will block only one web address that exactly matches a given URL. You must include the
          protocol (http:// or https://) at the beginning of the given URL for this option to work
          correctly most of the time (<i>https://www.reddit.com</i> instead of <i>www.reddit.com</i> or
          <i>reddit.com</i>).
        </p>
        <p>
          This option should only be used in rare cases.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="parent">Block URL and parent URL's</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          This option will block all web addresses that match a given URL or any of the URL's that precede it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blocking <i>reddit.com/r/*</i> with this option will block <i>reddit.com</i>, <i>reddit.com/r</i>,
          <i>reddit.com/r/abc</i>, <i>reddit.com/r/xyz</i>, etc. but will not block <i>reddit.com/r/abc/xyz</i>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="child">Block URL and child URL's</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          This option will block all web addresses that match a given URL or any of the URL's that succeed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blocking <i>reddit.com/r/*</i> with this option will block <i>reddit.com/r/abc</i>, <i>reddit.com/r/xyz</i>,
          <i>reddit.com/r/abc/xyz</i>, etc. but will not block <i>reddit.com</i> or <i>reddit.com/r</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blocking just <i>reddit.com</i> with this option will block the website entirely.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="keyword">Block keyword/pattern</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          This option will block every web address containing a given keyword or pattern in its URL.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, blocking <i>reddit</i> will block <i>reddit.com</i>, <i>reddit.com/r/abc</i>,
          <i>google.com/search?q=reddit</i>, <i>wikipedia.org/wiki/reddit</i>, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the most powerful block option and should be used responsibly, be careful when blocking common
          keywords/patterns!

        <b>Hint:</b> You must include the protocol (http:// or https://) at the beginning of the redirect URL for
        redirection to work correctly most of the time. Set your redirect URL to <i>chrome://newtab</i> to redirect
        blocked sites to your chrome new tab page.

      <h3>How do I unblock a website?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          You can unblock a website by finding it in the <a href="#blockedHeading">Blocked sites</a> table and
          left-mouse clicking
          the "Unblock" button on the right. You can also left-mouse click the "Unblock all" button to unblock every
          site in the
          table.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>How do I block a website and all of its pages?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          You can do this with either the <a href="#child">Block URL and child URL's</a> or
          <a href="#keyword">Block keyword/pattern</a> options.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>E.g. reddit.com, www.youtube.com, etc.</i>
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>How do I block a website and only some of its pages?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          You can do this with either the
          <a href="#parent">Block URL and parent URL's</a>,
          <a href="#child">Block URL and child URL's</a> or
          <a href="#keyword">Block keyword/pattern</a> options.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>How do I block every website starting with/ending with/containing some pattern(s)?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          You can do this with either the <a href="#child">Block URL and child URL's</a> or
          <a href="#keyword">Block keyword/pattern</a> options.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Why am I shown a "Your file was not found" page?</h3>
      <div>
        This page will appear if you attempt to access a blocked site and
        have not set a custom redirect URL. To see a different page when you attempt to access a blocked site please
        change your redirect URL <a href="#redirectHeading">here</a>.
      </div>
      <h3>Why isn't content loading on an unblocked site?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Because you blocked it! This happens because
          many unblocked sites will initiate images, videos, ads and other data from a blocked URL.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Why are blocked site embeds still appearing on other sites?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Social media (and other) embeds may still appear on the web after you have blocked their company sites. Even
          though the embeds are still visible,
          Site Blocker prevents these embeds from spying on you (embedded Facebook like
          buttons will be benign in nature, etc.).
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>How do I block ads?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          While you can block ads with this extension, I highly recommend you use an
          <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/adblock">ad-blocker</a> instead.
          Many ads on the web are loaded from URL's with no relation to the actual ad content,
          and finding the right URL/keyword to block is often a process of trial & error.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>How do I reset the wildcard character?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          The default wildcard character is *. You can change it <a href="#wildcardHeading">here</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>How do I reset the redirect URL?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Click the "Submit" button <a href="#redirectHeading">here</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>How do I enable this extension in incognito mode?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Right-mouse click the Site Blocker extension icon in the Chrome toolbar or menu and left-mouse
          click the "Manage extensions" option to access the extension settings page. Left-mouse click on the
          "Allow in incognito" toggle button if it is not already enabled.
        </p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <h3>How do I import blocked sites from a text file?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Click on the "Import sites from text file" button underneath <a href="#blockedHeading">Blocked sites</a> for
          more information.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>How do I sync my blocked sites across multiple devices?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Due to the limited capacity of Chrome online storage, the ability to sync blocked sites across multiple
          devices has been removed.
          To share blocked sites across devices please <a href="#downloadList">download your blocked sites as a text
            file</a> then
          <a href="#importList">import your blocked sites</a> to your other devices.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>How do I remove this extension?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Right-mouse click the Site Blocker extension icon in the Chrome toolbar or menu and left-mouse
          click the "Remove from Chrome..." option in the spawned menu to remove this extension from your browser.

      </div>
      <h3>Can I block a website with two or more block options?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          No, if you feel the need to use two or more block options for a desired effect - there should be a way to
          achieve it with
          only one block option. If you're stuck please feel free to contact me.

      <h3>Does this extension track me?</h3>
      <div>

          You can import any text file with a list of sites seperated by commas or whitespace.

        <p>
          Optionally, if you want to define block options for the sites in your text file, you can write your desired
          block option(s) preceded by two asterisks (**) in the file itself.
          Any site that is below a defined block option in your file will be automatically blocked with that block
          option when imported (see the second example below).

          Sites that are not below a defined block option in your file will be blocked with the <strong>Block URL and
